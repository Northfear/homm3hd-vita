My (failed) attempt of doing wrapper/port for Android version of Heroes of Might and Magic 3 HD to PS Vita.

It's possible to start the game and even get in-game with it, but the rendering was seriously messed up (number of FBOs is going out of Vita limit (which was fixeable with kernel plugin, but there were many other problems too)), so I haven't really bothered doing anything else with it.

Uploading it for historical purposes. Maybe someone else, more knowledgeable with GLES, would like to give it a go (it's buildable with the usual hardfp VitaSDK).
